A Symfony project created on March 2, 2017, 1:40 pm.

TO DO
=====

Connect people to projects in a meaningful way. It should be easy to add
individuals to projects (A is a presenter at B, C exhibited at D, etc).

Consider adding pages to projects (there may be many different pages of
context associated with a project - probably the same with artworks).

Define thumb, small, medium, and large image sizes. Keep the originals.

Add an easy way of associating images with projects, people, and artworks.
